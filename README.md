### Hi there, I'm Lukáš 👋

I'm a 15-year-old IT student from the Czech Republic 🇨🇿 with a growing passion for Linux, automation, and programming.

My journey into code started with a simple desire to learn something new. I began with Python, and that initial spark has made me excited to keep learning and build a foundation for a future in technology. I'm fascinated by how things work, from simple scripts to the hardware they run on.

* 🐧 I'm an enthusiastic **Linux** user and enjoy working in **Ubuntu** and **Bash**.
* 🌱 I'm currently focused on **learning the fundamentals** of several tools and languages at once.
* 💡 I'm looking for my first opportunity to contribute to a beginner-friendly open-source project.
